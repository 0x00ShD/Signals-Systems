### Signals & Systems :
The "Signals & Systems" course provides a foundational understanding of the principles and techniques used to analyze and process signals and systems in both continuous and discrete time domains. The course covers topics such as:

- Signal Representation: Introduction to different types of signals (periodic, aperiodic, continuous, discrete) and their mathematical representation.
- System Properties: Study of systems' characteristics such as linearity, time-invariance, causality, and stability.
- Fourier Series & Transform: Exploration of Fourier series for periodic signals and Fourier transform for analyzing signal frequency content.
- Laplace Transform: Understanding the Laplace transform and its application in analyzing and solving linear time-invariant (LTI) systems.
- Z-Transform: Application of Z-transform for discrete-time signal analysis and its role in discrete-time systems.
- Convolution: Detailed study of the convolution process, essential for understanding how systems respond to inputs.
- Sampling Theorem: Introduction to the sampling theorem and its implications for converting continuous signals into discrete signals.
- State-Space Analysis: Overview of state-space methods for modeling and analyzing dynamic systems.
